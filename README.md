This is a Computer Security Final Project in Yangping Zhang's CPSC 448 class. 

Trevor Greenside: SQL Injections

Evan Conrad: Javascript Injections

Maxwell Dulin: Clipboard Injections

Both Evan and Trevor are making websites to test this out on. 

If you would like to use The clipboard injections file, then you will need to install win32clipboard for the current version of python that you are running. After that, just run the pythonAttack.pyw file. You can go in and change the parameters for attacking. By default, it looks for a user to put the value "52" onto the clipboard.
