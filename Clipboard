In the first week I decided to look up how to alter the clipboard on a windows machine from an application that was always running. 
SetClipboardData is an API that allows the user to alter the clipboard. Currently, this is my number one idea on how to do this. 
Being an APT(advanced persistent threat), I was curious how we could get this on the person's computer. So, I have been messing around with 
downloading Microsoft Word files from the internet, then having them execute a command to open powershell. From there, someone could 
easily run a command to run the malware to change the application.
